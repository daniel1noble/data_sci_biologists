# **Introduction**

### Assignment Task{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The goal of this assignment is to conduct a meta-analysis on ocean acidification effects on behaviour. Recall the paper by [Clark *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y) that we worked on in week 6. This study was an experimental study across 5-6 different reef fish that looked at comparing the effect of elevated $CO^2$ (in ppm) relative to some control on fish behaviour. That study, you might recall, did not find strong evidence that increased acidification had effects on activity. 

But, this was just a single study (albeit done on 6 species). In this assignment we want to use meta-analysis to understand: 1) to estimate th overall effect and determine if these effects are general across studies conducting similar experiments; 2) how variable the effect size is within the literature and 3) what factors (biological, methodological, publication practices) explain variation in effect size. 

### Assessment{.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

The assessment is worth **40%** of your final mark. You will be assessed on three major areas: 1) Statistical Analysis and Interpretation; 2) Reproducibility and 3) Coding and Writing Structure & Presentation. Below we detail in each section what we are looking for: 

1) **Statistical Analysis and Interpretation (50%)**
  + Correct analysis of [Clark *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y) data to generate the summary statistics (means, SD, N) for each of the fish species' average activity. 
  + Correctly merge summary statistics from [Clark *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y) into the larger dataset. 
  + Correctly calculate the log response ratio (lnRR) effect size for every row of the dataframe
  + Correct meta-analytic model fitted to the data that uses sampling variance of lnRR as weights and that includes additional random effects.
  + 
  
2) **Reproducibility (30%)**:
  + Code, analysis and data is setup in a **public** *GitHub* Repository
  + Workflow, meta-data and file structure is clearly documented (using a README file) as is the history of changes for each file.
  + Rmarkdown documents follow reproducibility principles:
    + They render as an html!
    + Use Figure and Table code chunks that are referenced in text.
    + Writing of findings is done using inline code chunks with reference to specific object values.

3) **Coding and Writing Structure & Presentation (20%)**: 
  + Code is clearly annotated and only what is needed is presented
  + Figure and Tables have clear and well labelled captions and that are informative
