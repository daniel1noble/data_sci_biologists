## **Assignment Task** {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

<br> 
The goal of this assignment is to conduct a meta-analysis on ocean acidification effects on behaviour. Recall the paper by [Clark *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y) that we worked on in week 6. This study was an experimental study across 5-6 different reef fish that looked at comparing the effect of elevated $CO^2$ (in ppm) relative to some control on fish behaviour. That study, you might recall, did not find strong evidence that increased acidification had effects on activity. 

But, this was just a single study (albeit done on 6 species). In this assignment we want to use meta-analysis to: 
  
  1) estimate the overall effect of ocean acidification on behaviour and determine if these effects are general across studies conducting similar experiments; 
  2) understand how variable the effect size is within the literature 
  3) what factors (biological, methodological, publication practices) explain variation in effect size.

<br>
**The assessment is worth 40% of your final mark**. You will be assessed on three major areas: 1) Statistical Analysis and Interpretation; 2) Reproducibility and 3) Coding, Writing Structure & Presentation. Below we detail in each section what we are looking for: 

1) **Statistical Analysis and Interpretation (50%)**
+ Correct analysis of [Clark *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y) data to generate the summary statistics (means, SD, N) for each of the fish species' average activity. 
+ Through coding, merge the summary statistics generated from above with the papers metadata.
+ Through coding, correctly merge summary statistics from [Clark *et al.* (2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y) into the larger meta-analysis dataset. 
+ Correctly calculate the log response ratio (lnRR) effect size for every row of the dataframe using metafor's `escalc()` function.
+ Correct meta-analytic model fitted to the data that uses sampling variance of lnRR and that includes additional random effects.
+ Funnel plot for visually assessing the possibility of publication bias.
+ Time-lag plot assessing how effect sizes may or may not have changed through time.
+ Formal meta-regression model that includes year as a moderator (fixed effect) to test for time-lag bias
+ Formal meta-regression model that includes inverse sampling variance to test for file-drawer biases
  
2) **Reproducibility (30%)**:
+ Code, analysis and data is setup in a **public** *GitHub* Repository
+ Workflow, meta-data and file structure is clearly documented (using a README file) as is the history of changes for each file.
+ Rmarkdown documents follow reproducibility principles:
  + Rmarkdown document renders as an html!
  + Use Figure and Table code chunks that are referenced in text.
  + Writing of findings is done using inline code chunks with reference to specific object values.

3) **Coding, Writing Structure & Presentation (20%)**: 
+ Code is clearly annotated, clean, and only what is needed is presented
+ Figure and Tables have clear and well labelled captions that are informative and correctly referenced within the document.
